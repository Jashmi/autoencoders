There are four python files:
1) initialize.py
2) bulid.py
3) layers.py
4) utils.py

Run the initialize.py by setting the input params(activation func name, cost func name, number of epochs, learning rate, momentum, batch size,number of train batches,etc) as required. (Note that the encoding layers should be equal to the decoding layers)
The code requires TrainImages, ValImages , TestImages to run.
For demo purposes, the given run file(initialize.py) has few parameters pre initialized.

Also, the code is available on github as well(https://github.com/AkshayKhanolkar/AutoEncoders)
